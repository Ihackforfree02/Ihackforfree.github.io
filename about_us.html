    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm a student who built this website in my spare time, just for fun and to learn more about web development. I love games, design, and creating cool things people can interact with online.</p>
    
    <p>I'm always open to including tributes to other amazing players or community members who inspire me. If you’ve got ideas or want to be a part of it—I'd love to hear from you!</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for stopping by and supporting my journey. ✌️</p>
